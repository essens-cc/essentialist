# The Essentialist Template

Hey! Thank you for your interest in my work. Feel free to experiment with this template and to make it your own. View the [demo](https://essentialist-nine.vercel.app/).

The goal and the idea was to made as flexible template as possible so that anyone could use it to create a stylish hq on the internet. I wanted it to become a noise-cancelling anchor for someone focused on building a high-signal and meaningful life. 

For those interested, the "spirited man" — comes from the "[Shop Class as Soulcraft](https://www.amazon.com/Shop-Class-Soulcraft-Inquiry-Value/dp/0143117467?keywords=soulcraft&qid=1700379052&sr=8-3)" book.

## Customize

Most of the data displayed (name, contacts, etc) on the page exists in one single file — `persona.js` (`src/persona.js`). Here you can add your own info such as name, email, and much more. 

Mind that there is a an object here, where you can create additional sections. Jut don't forget to create them in the `index.astro` as well.

This template is designed to be a single-screen website. Yet you still can add more sections, and customize it further if needed. For example, there is an `Navigation` component (`src/componetnts/Navigation.astro`) that depends on the `nav.js` (`src/nav.js`) data. So if you want to add pages to the website, consider reading [this](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/) and [this](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/) first.

If you want to costomize color theme, go to `tailwind.config.mjs`. All the changes will be automaticall applied to the whole theme.
